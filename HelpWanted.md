# Rococoa Needs Help #

## Review ##

I'm a Java hacker, and know very little Objective-C.

Actually, I now know more about the internals than I could possibly want to, but I'm really not fluent in the ways of Cocoa.

I'd really appreciate a review by someone who does know Objective-C, and ideally some Java, to see if there are any issues that I haven't thought about.

If you're really a Objective-C wizard, maybe you could look over [objc\_msgSend.html Returning values from objc\_msgSend etc] and answer the questions there.

## Development ##

If you'd like to help with development, that would be great too.

## Contrib ##

Whilst writing Java wrappers for Cocoa classes isn't hard, it would be nice if there was more available out of the box.

If you've wrapped an Objective-C class we don't have, or extended an available one, please send them back.

In all cases, [posting](https://rococoa.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList) to the user or dev mailing list is probably the best way to get attention
