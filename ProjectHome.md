Rococoa allows you to call Objective-C code through Java classes and interfaces that you define.

# Welcome to Rococoa #

Rococoa is a generic Java binding to the Mac Objective-C object system. It
allows the creation and use of Objective-C objects in Java, and the
implementation of Objective-C interfaces in Java.

_Fair Warning_

Rococoa is very much work in progress. Much is subject to change. A lot isn't
good enough not to change. But given the recent deprecation of the Java-Cocoa
bridge, it's the best I've got. Just mind your head. And please give feedback in the
[mailing list](https://rococoa.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList).

Oh, one big warning. Rococoa on PPC passes all but one of its tests, but that
shows that it has an [issue](http://code.google.com/p/rococoa/issues/detail?id=3) returning longs from Objective-C methods. Please do
try it on PPC, and report any other problems to the project [mailing list](https://rococoa.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList).
